# Data

The raw data was obtained via the following methods:
* For `cb_2018_25_cousub_500k.zip`, go to `https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html` and download the 2018 Massachusetts County Subdivisions.
* For `NLCD_MA_2016.tif`, I ran `download_nlcd.js` within the interactive Google Earth Engine server. The result was copied from Google Drive to the `raw/` folder.
